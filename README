Senior Project: Leia Chang

TODO:
- Refactor for better IO
    - TinyObjLoader for csv?
- Add mousetracking from 471 lab01

Data used for skeleton retrieval:
- Left front waist
- Right front waist
- Right back head
- Left back head


Things I need to do:
- Take out these coordinates (lwaist, rwaist)
- Draw the line (lwaist to rwaist)
    - How do we do this?
